3. Enter the starting and ending rows that you would like to run. For example, with reference to the first image, if you would like to tweet content from the 2nd row to the fourth row only, enter 2 and 4 into the starting and ending row respectively. You are recommended to run it in batches to prevent getting banned by twitter. Press the function you would like to run. 

5. Once you run twitter.exe, a chrome browser will appear. You have 90 seconds to enter your twitter credentials to get logged in manually. Wait until the 90 seconds are up and the programme will run automatically.
